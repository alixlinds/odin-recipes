    <h2>A Mexican Staple</h2>

    <p> A taco is a traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or 
        wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling. 
        The tortilla is then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul><li>1 pound ground beef, or ground turkey</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>8 taco-size corn or flour tortillas</li>
        <li>Toppings, as desired: shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, 
            chopped tomatoes, sour cream, avocado, guacamole, cilantro, chopped 
            red onion, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>

    <ol><li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef to the skillet and 
        cook, crumbling with a spoon or spatula, until browned. Drain any excess grease 
        from the skillet. (If you used 90% or 93% lean ground beef there may not be any 
        extra grease to drain.)</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, dried 
            oregano, onion powder, salt, pepper, tomato sauce and water to the skillet. Stir 
            to combine and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, until taco meat is fully 
            cooked and has reached your desired texture.</li>
        <li>Serve the taco meat in warmed tortillas, with toppings as desired.</li>
    </ol>
